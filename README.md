#  Smart Urban Flood Management System 
An advanced flood monitoring and prevention system that integrates **IoT**, **Machine Learning**, and **Cloud Technologies** to provide real-time data, predictive analytics, and automated alerts—empowering smart cities with faster response and proactive maintenance.

---

## Overview

This project aims to tackle **urban flooding** by deploying a **data-driven**, intelligent system to monitor water levels, detect potential hazards, and predict blockages in drainage systems. The system leverages **Arduino/Raspberry Pi**, multiple sensors, **cloud dashboards**, and **machine learning models** to enhance urban flood resilience.

---

## Key Features

- **IoT-Based Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Collects continuous data from sensors placed in manholes and drains.

- **Machine Learning-Based Prediction**  
  Predicts flooding or blockage using historical sensor data.

- **Multi-Sensor Integration**  
  Monitors water levels, toxic gases (like methane), and debris presence.

- **Cloud Communication**  
  Transmits data via **MQTT/HTTP** using **Wi-Fi**, **GSM**, or **LoRa** to a central server.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**  
  Displays live data on **Node-RED**, **AWS IoT**, or **Grafana** dashboards.

- **Automated Alerts**  
  Sends **SMS**, **email**, and **buzzer alerts** when thresholds are exceeded.

- **Field-Tested Accuracy**  
  System reliability is validated through real-world testing.
